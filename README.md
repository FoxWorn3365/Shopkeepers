**‚ö†Ô∏è We are not in any way related to the [Shopkeepers plugin](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/shopkeepers) for Bukkit!**

## Introduction video
<video src='test.mp4'></video>

## Features
- Players can create theyr own Shopkeepers and manage it
- Admin Shopkeepers
- Vanilla trade page
- Shopkeeper inventory for non-admin Shopkeepers
- Hit prevention for shopkeepers
- Easy configuration with in-game GUI

## Compatibility
**Shopkeepers** is made to be multi-version, in fact I announce with great joy that the plugin is available for both PocketMine-MP 5 and PocketMine-MP 4!

## Commands
The base command is `/shopkeepers` but you can also use `/sk`, `/skeepers` and `/shopk` as aliases.
Here a list of all commands that you can use:
| Command | Args | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| info | none | Show the plugin's informations |
| info | SHOP NAME | Show the shop configuration page |
| edit | SHOP NAME | Edit the shop recepies |
| create | SHOP NAME / NULL | Create a new shop, if the name is leaved empty will be generated |
| summon | SHOP NAME | Summon a Shopkeeper entity (as a Villager) for your Shop |
| rename | SHOP NAME and NEW NAME | [NOT AVAILABLE] Rename a current shop |
| list | none | Show all of your shops |

## F.A.Q.
### How to create an Admin shop
There is not really an Admin shop but you can activate this function by using the command `/sk info <SHOP NAME>` and then clicking on the Blaze Powder and then clicking on the red wool block that has "Admin shop" as its name

### How to see a Shopkeeper's inventory
There are two ways:
- Use the command `/sk info <SHOP NAME>` and then click on the chest at the center of the GUI
- Click on the Shopkeeper (Villager) entity

### I want to access to the Shopkeeper's trade page but if i click the entity i access the inventory!
Easy: shift and click on the Shopkeeper

### How to despawn a Shopkeeper
More easy: just hit it, it will die in only one hit!

## Bug reporting
Reporting bugs ~~to developers~~ to the developerüò¢ is very important to ensure the stability of the plugin, so in order to better track and manage all reports it is **incredibly necessary** that they are reported via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/FoxWorn3365/Shopkeepers/issues).<br>
Here is what to include in the reporting to make it perfect:
1. The **complete** crash error
> If it is not complete how do we know how it all happened?
2. All files from the `plugin_data/Shopkeepers` folder
> This way we can compare the error with those files to find a possible transcription error
3. The plugin's version
> It changes a lot from version to version, and this would help us a lot to understand where to look for
4. (OPTIONAL) The plugin download source
> Knowing where you downloaded the plugin from might help, always better to know some information
5. (OPTIONAL) The `Shopkeepers.phar`
> "Last wade," in case we can analyze the source

## Contribution guide
Any contribution is greatly appreciated because you help me to lighten my workload, so here are some small guidelines to follow when you want to contribute:
- Clear code
> I don't want to see things like this:
```php
class Fox {
    protected $fox;  // WHAT'S THE TYPE?????'?'Q'2'wqiadw sdfbuhwhwrf jhs

    function create($int, $bruh) { $bruh = 10-$int+$bruh; // AAAAAAAAAA. IT'S A PUBLIC, PRIVATE OR PROTECTED FUNCTION?!?!??!?
    return $bruh;                                       // AND WHAT'S THE RETURN TYPE???? AND WHY THE CODE IS IN THE FIRST LINE????????
    }
}
```
- Update the "headers" of the file correctly
> They allow new contributors to understand what the file is for without having them parse 250 lines, so update them with the true purpose of the file!

## Developers: shop object
The plugin needs to save store data, and unlike other plugins, it uses .json files so they are more accessible to server owners, so here is the structure.<br>
As a reminder, the plugin saves each player's data in separate files, so there will be a `PlayerName.json` for each player that creates a shop.<br>
Now, let's see the object:
```json
{
    "author":"<PlayerNAME>",
    "admin":false,
    "title":"<ShopNAME>",
    "namevisible":false,
    "inventory":[],
    "items":[
        {
            "buy":nbtSerializedItem,
            "sell":nbtSerializedItem
        }
    ]
}
```
| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| author | string | The username of the shop author |
| admin | bool | If the shop is an Admin shop, so you don't have to put items in the inventory and you won't earn anything |
| title | string | The real name of the shop |
| namevisible | bool | Should the shop name be visible when summoned? |
| inventory | array | The inventory of the shop |
| items | array | A list of all recepies (max 9) |

## Special thanks
Thanks to [Muqsit](https://github.com/Muqsit) for the [InvMenu](https://github.com/Muqsit/InvMenu) virion who have contributed to the creation for this plugin!<br>
Also [this plugin](https://github.com/FrozenArea/TradeAPI) helped me!

## Roadmap
- [x] Update the item object because now it's the old one
- [x] Make if the ContainerClose packet is received unset the `$this->trades->{PLAYER}` object because otherwise is OP!
- [x] Updated the item object with nbt
- [x] Working Admin shop (without inventory)
- [x] Inventory saving correctly 
- [x] Player shop
- [x] Shopkeeper's inventory updating when players buy
- [x] Shopkeeper deny a trade if the inventory is without the item
- [ ] Online shopkeeper editor
- [ ] Online shopkeeper shop (yes, you will be able to make shopping from your phone on the subway!)
